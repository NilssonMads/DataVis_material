Data must be from same source)  o Example: scatter plot (like the twitter plot where we saw bot pattern)    1D Spatial:  E.g. a column of positions (long, lat)  • Dotmap  o equivalence of scatterplot on geospatial data (ex: crime map plot)  • Heatmap  • Binned Dotmap (brings out differences in distributions)  2D  2D Quantitative, Quantitative:  Pairs of numbers  • Scatterplot (alternatively binned scatterplot if you have t

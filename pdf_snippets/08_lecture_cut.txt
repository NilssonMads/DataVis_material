WHY TALK ABOUT MULTIVARIATE VIS?
Mapping two attributes 
(Position)
Mapping three attributes
(Position, Area)
Mapping four Attributes 
(Position, Area, Color)
Mapping five Attributes 
(Position, Area, Color, Shape)
This does not scale!DAVI FALL 2024

PAIRED SPLOM / DENSITY CONTOURS
SPLOM w/ Density Contours:
Use mirrored half of the SPLOM to 
embed other plots – e.g., density 
contours to highlight areas of 
potential overplotting in the SPLOM

RADVIZ
In RadViz, each attribute is assigned
an anchor on the circumference
of a circular drawing area. 
Each data point is “pulled towards” the
different attribute anchors with a force
proportional to the respective value.
(Barycentric Coordinates)

RADVIZ DELUXE
RadViz Deluxe corrects for some of the errors in RadViz – e.g., through a better placement of 
the anchors that reflects their pairwise correlations:

1D 
1D Quantitative: 
Just a set of numbers, e.g. all ages in the room 
• Histogram 
• Violin 
• Boxplot, Box and whiskers plot 
• Bee swarm plot 
 
 
1D Qualitative: 
All we have are categorical values e.g. haircolors 
• Piechart 
• Waffle chart (works as long as not too many data points) 
• Barchart 
• Radarchart (works as long as not too many categories) 
• Treemap (scale areas of tree maps according to time) 
1D Temporal:  
All we have is a series of time steps (i.e. no related quantity).  
• Histogram (if data not too sparse) 
• Instance chart (time on one axis and then data plotted as instances) 
o Can be transformed into 1D heatmap 
• Time map (plotting time from previous event on x-axis, time to next event on y-axis. 
Data must be from same source) 
o Example: scatter plot (like the twitter plot where we saw bot pattern) 
 
1D Spatial: 
E.g. a column of positions (long, lat) 
• Dotmap 
o equivalence of scatterplot on geospatial data (ex: crime map plot) 
• Heatmap 
• Binned Dotmap (brings out differences in distributions) 
2D 
2D Quantitative, Quantitative: 
Pairs of numbers 
• Scatterplot (alternatively binned scatterplot if you have too many data points) 
 
• Bubble chart 
• Heat map 
• Marimekko chart (turn quantitative features into qualitative by binning, kind of like a 
2d histogram but drawing space is divided) 
o Mosaic plot is Marimekko chart with qualities. Marimekko is for quantities 
only. 
• Parallel sets (if values are binned) 
2D Quantitative, Qualitative: 
Pairs of categorical values and numerical values 
- Mix of mosaic and marimekko chart (not either since those are only for qual., 
quant., respectively) 
- Parallel sets (with quantitative binned) 
Note: We cannot use a bar chart since we’d need a one-to-one function mapping.  
2D Qualitative, Qualitative: 
• Mosaic plot 
 
• Parallel sets (mapping onto area)  
 
• Matrix display (mapping onto color) 
2D quantitative, temporal:  
One quantity for each timestamp. 
• Line chart (assuming we don’t have multiple values for same timepoint (one-to-
one)) 
• Area chart 
2D qualitative, temporal: 
Some quality for each timestamp. 
• Stacked bar chart (discrete – like time on Mondays-) 
• Stacked area chart (continuous temporal resolution) 
2D Quantitative, Spatial (area): 
• Choropleth map (when measurement is given for area (e.g. country)) 
• Cartogram 
2D Quantitative, Spatial (point): 
• Isopleth map  
• Bubble map 
2D Qualitative, Spatial (area): 
• Choropleth map 
2D Qualitative, Spatial (point): 
• Chorochromatic map (equivalent to isopleth map) 
2D Spatial, temporal 
• Space-Time cube (dimension as 3rd dimension) 
• Small Multiples  
o e.g. grid of timestamped choropleth maps 
o “Poor man’s Trellis Plot” - Hans-Jörg 🙂‍ ↕️  
• Animation (mapping time onto display time) 
2D Spatial, Spatial 
• Flow map (alternatively, origin-destination map) 
2D Temporal, Temporal: 
Pairs of time data points/values 
• Triangular model 
• Gantt chart 
 
 
3D 
 3D Quantitative, Quantitative, Quantitative 
• Bubble chart  
• Ternary plot (condition = add up to 1) 
• Parallel coordinates 
• Scatterplot matrix  
• Radar chart (condition = not too many datapoints) 
• Radviz/Radviz++/Radviz deluxe 
• Marimekko chart (mosaic chart for quantitative variables) 
3D Quantitative, Quantitative, Qualitative 
... 
3D Quant, Quant, Temp: 
• Connected scatterplot 
3D Spatial, Spatial, Temporal:  
• Small Multiples with Flowmaps 
 
5D Qualitative, Qualitative, Qualitative, Qualitative, Qualitative: 
•  
5D Quantitative, Quantitative, Quantitative, Quantitative, Quantitative: 
• Scatterplot matrix 
• Parallel coordinates

Why 3D Visualisation?
8
• Many scientific domains produce 
3D datasets: 
• Medicine (CT, MRI) 
• Fluid dynamics, CFD 
• Geoscience & atmospheric 
models 
• Photogrammetry 
• Molecular structures 
• 2D projections can obscure: 
• Spatial correspondence 
• Internal structures 
• Occluded surfaces
Why is 3D Visualization Challenging?
9
• Occlusion:  
• 3D scenes naturally hide parts of the data from view 
• Perspective distortion & depth ambiguity 
• Users struggle to perceive depth accurately without additional cues 
• Navigation complexity 
• Manipulating a 3D viewpoint adds cognitive load 
• High data sizes 
• Volumetric data can become very large and requires optimised 
rendering (GPU rendering) 
• There is a need for specialised techniques rather than simply 
extending 2D visualisations into 3DDepth Cues & Perception
10
• Shading (Phong, Blinn–Phong) 
Essential for conveying shape on surfaces 
• Shadowing & occlusion techniques 
Improve depth perception and reveal structure 
• Color coding, transparency, and transfer 
functions -> Important in volume visualisation 
• Cutting planes and slicing 
Reduce clutter and reveal occluded internal 
structures
3D Visualisation
11
• 3D Visualization is the process of 
transforming complex (sometimes 
abstract) 3D data into an intuitive 
graphical representation 
• Goal: Gain insight ->  not just make 
pretty pictures 
• Why 3D? 
• Intuitive Perception: Our brains are 
built for 3D 
• Spatial Relationships: Understand 
"what's next to," "inside of," or 
"behind" something else 
• Data Density: We can encode more 
information (x,y,z + color, size, opacity)
(3D) Visualisation Pipeline
12
• 3D Example: 
• Data (Raw Data): Raw CT scan - a huge file of numbers. 
• Filtering (Data Prep): Smooth the data to reduce noise/Filter out irrelevant information (e.g. 
air) 
• Mapping ("Artistic" Step): Decide what the data looks like -> map data values to visual 
properties 
• Density values to colour 
• Density values to opacity 
• Specific density (like bone) to a surface (an isosurface) 
• Rendering (Creating the Picture): Creates final 2D image (calculating lighting, shadows, 
and perspective)

13
• Effective when spatial or volumetric relationships are critical 
• Ineffective when projection or occlusion obscure structure 
• Hybrid approaches (e.g., linked 2D–3D views) often 
outperform pure 3D3D Data Types and Representations
14
Data type Representation Visualization techniques
Scalar fields Volumetric grids (voxels) Volume rendering, isosurfaces
Vector fields Flow data (velocity, wind) Streamlines, glyphs, particle tracing
Geometric Data Meshes, point clouds Surface rendering, shading
Multivariate spatial data Geometry + attributes Color mapping, texture, transparencyHow do 2D Concepts map to 3D Visualisation
15
Concept In 2D Visualization In 3D Visualization
Data–space mapping (x, y) → pixel position (x, y, z) → voxel or vertex position
Mark encoding Shape, color, size Geometry, material, illumination
Projection Orthographic, map projection Perspective projection, camera transforms
Interaction Pan, zoom, filter Orbit, flythrough, slicing, selection in depthImportant Fundamentals
16
• Camera model: viewpoint, field of view, projection type 
• Lighting model: how shading conveys shape and depth 
• Transparency and volume rendering: controlling visibility of 
interior structures 
• Interaction metaphors: orbit, slice, 3D selectionInteraction
17
• Basic Interaction: Zoom, Pan, Rotate: 
• Needed because of occlusion: 3D objects may hide behind 
other 3D objects 
• Data Interaction: 
• Slicing: "virtual knife" to cut open a 3D model 
• Brushing: Selecting data in one view (e.g., a 3D scatter plot) 
and seeing it highlight in another (a 2D histogram). 
• Editing: Changing the Transfer Function Display
18
• Screen (Standard): “2D window into the 
3D world” 
• Virtual Reality (VR):  
• Immersive: Users are inside data 
• Used for complex data exploration, 
simulations 
• Augmented Reality (AR):  
• Contextual 
• Overlaying data onto real world 
• Used in engineering, medicine, or 
architecture
Key Concept: Projection (Going from 3D to 2D)
19
• Perspective Projection 
• Things farther away appear smaller 
• Mimics how the human eye works 
• Use:  
• Games, movies, realistic visualisation 
• Orthographic Projection 
• Size does not change with distance 
• Parallel lines remain parallel 
• Use: Technical blueprints, CAD, engineering design (where 
measurements are key)

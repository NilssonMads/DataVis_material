WHY TALK ABOUT VISUAL MAPPING?
• Need to parametrize a preset chart
-> e.g., which color scale to use
• Need to adjust a base chart
-> e.g., to counter a perceptual bias
• Need to build your own chart type
-> e.g., to tailor it to a dataset
• Need to detect when someone tries to
deceive you with a chart
-> Visual Literacy

INTERLUDE: THE HUMAN EYE
Pupil: to adjust brightness
Lens: to adjust focus
Retina: the projection surface at the back of the eye
Fovea/Macula: for high-res color perception
                             under daylight (photopic vision)
  -> ca. 64% red cones
  -> ca. 32% green cones               6-7 million cones
  -> ca. 2% blue cones
Remainder of Retina: for low-res brightness perception
                                under low light levels (scotopic vision)
  -> 120 million rods

WHAT IS DATA?
​                 The DIKW Hierarchy
• Facts (e.g., names and favorite colors)
• Measurements (e.g., weight and length)
• Observations (e.g., eye color and spoken languages)
• Distributions (e.g., trends, clusters, outliers)
• Relations (e.g., correlations, associations)
• Recognition (e.g., classification, matching)
• Models (e.g., simulation models, statistical models)
• Parameters (e.g., controls, influencing factors)
• Limitations (e.g., boundary conditions)
• Prognoses (e.g., decision X will lead to outcome Y)
• Reasoning (e.g., if X leads to Y, then X’ will lead to Y’)
• Adaptation (e.g., situation Z => situation Z’)

Frame of reference for any measured or
observed data characteristic. Examples:
- Latitude / Longitude
- Time
- CPR number
Important Properties:
- Extent of Validity: point, local, global
- Topology, Grid type
Gathered data at a particular reference point.
Examples:
- Temperature
- CO2 concentration
- Wind speed & direction
Important Properties:
- Data type: categorical, numerical,…
- Data structure: scalar, vector, tensor
- Value ranges

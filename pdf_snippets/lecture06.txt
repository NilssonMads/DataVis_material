OVERVIEW
​1. Data Profiling, e.g. -
• Determine access modalities
• Establish / validate data characteristics
​2. Data Wrangling, e.g. -
• Check data for correctness and fix data where possible
• Fuse data from multiple sources
​3. Data Transformation / Reduction, e.g. -
• Sampling data
• Aggregating data

DATA PROFILING
​Data profiling := the process of diagnosing a new or otherwise unknown dataset for its
access modalities and data space characteristics
​Access modalities: how often, how much, how detailed data can be retrieved (GDPR!)
• Different character encodings (ASCII vs. UTF-8 vs. ISO-8859 …)
• Different number formats (10,000.00 vs. 10000,00 vs. 1E+4 …)
• Different date formats (09-NOV-2011 vs. 09.11.2011 vs. 11/09/11…)
• Different time formats (16.20 vs. 4.20pm vs. 04:20:00 …)
• Different time zones / standards (UTC vs. GMT vs. EPOCH …)
• Different coordinate formats (DMS vs. Decimal DMS vs. UTM …)DATA PREPROCESSING HANS-JÖRG SCHULZ

DATA SPACE CHARACTERISTICS
​Determine what are you looking at and whether it is plausible
• incl. data formatting (e.g., IP addresses, lat/lon coordinates, license plates, CPR#,…)
• value ranges (e.g., lat: -90°…+90°, lon: -180°…+180°)
• units (e.g., Celsius (-273.15°C…), Fahrenheit (-459.67°F…) or Kelvin (0K…))
• placeholders (e.g., std::numeric_limits<float>::max() )
• consistency (e.g., noisy sensor but whole data values, time running backwards)
• topology of data structure (e.g., if tree structure, check  #edges +1 = #nodes)
• distribution of numbers (Benford’s law), words (Zipf’s law)DATA PREPROCESSING HANS-JÖRG SCHULZ

MAKE USE OF KNOWN VALUE RANGES!
​Sensible value ranges as simple guards against “bad” data:
e.g., Temperature
• Body Temperature: 10°C … 50°C
min record that was survived: 14.2°C
max record that was survived: 46.5°C
• Room Temperature: 0°C … 60°C
• Surface Temperature: -100°C … +100°
min record: Vostok Station in Antarctica with -89.2°C on July 21, 1983
max record: Death Valley in California with +56.7°C on July 10, 1913
         -> surface temperature: Lut Desert in Iran with +70.7°C in 2004/2005
• General Temperature: -273.15°C …DATA PREPROCESSING HANS-JÖRG SCHULZ

THE PROBLEM(S) WITH “STANDARDS”
• Competing Standards
• Different versions of the same standard
• Flexibility in interpreting the standard
• Incomplete implementations of the standard
• Standardized data still requires validation
• Not all required information may be part of the standar

NESTED MODEL
 Domain: application field … usage scenario
      => target users
      => needs for visualization
      => representational conventions
Data / Task: what is to be shown to which end
      => abstract data description
      => abstract task description
      => which task on which data -> workflow
Visual encoding: how shall the data be shown
      => visual entity budget / decluttering
      => positioning / placement w.r.t. mental map
      => labeling
Algorithm: how to realize / implement that
      => iterative / incremental
      => optimal / heuristic
      => fixed / parametrizable

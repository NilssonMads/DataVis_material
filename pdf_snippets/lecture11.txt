WHY TALK ABOUT GRAPH VISUALIZATION?
Graphs / networks put two data items into relation to each other.
• Social networks
• Computer networks
• Call graphs of a software
• Traffic networks
• …
If that relation is hierarchical, we also speak of a tree structure.GRAPH VISUALIZATION HANS-JÖRG SCHULZ

FUNDAMENTAL TERMS
​Data item => Node
​Data relation => Edge
​# of Data items related to a given data item X => Degree of X
​Numerical attributes of nodes and edges => Weights
​Graph w/o cycles => Tree
​Dedicated node of a tree => Root
​Data item A (closer to the root) having an edge to B (further from the root)
​       => A is the Parent, B is the Child
Nodes having the same parent => Siblings
Nodes having no children => Leaves
​Average # of children in a tree => Branching factorGRAPH VISUALIZATION HANS-JÖRG SCHULZ

A FORCE-DIRECTED LAYOUT ALGORITHM
​1. Initialize Node Positions (e.g., randomly or via pre-layout)
​2. For a number of iterations do
3. For all node pairs (u,v) do
4. Computer Repulsive Force according to Coulomb’s Law: FC=kr(Q1*Q2/r2)
5. Move u and v apart from each other by a distance FC
6. For all edges (u,v) do
7. Compute Attracting Force according to Hooke’s Law: FH=-ka * x
8. Move u and v closer to each other by FH

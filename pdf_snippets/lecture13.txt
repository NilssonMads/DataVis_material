VISUAL ANALYTICS
​“Visual analytics combines automated analysis techniques with interactive
visualizations for an effective understanding, reasoning and decision
making on the basis of very large and complex datasets.”
​Keim et al. 2008

WHY TALK ABOUT VISUAL ANALYTICS?
VA comes with a series of challenges in its own right:
• Computational analysis is often a long-running, time consuming process,
while visual data analysis is fast-paced and interactive.
• Visualization must not only be expressive of the underlying data, but the
underlying computational processes
• The aim of VA is
• ill-defined: “generate insight in the data”
• subjective: “confirm the expected and discover the unexpected”
• elusive / iterative: the moment you reach an analysis goal, it shifts…
• constrained: results must be ready to base timely decisions on themVISUAL ANALYTICS HANS-JÖRG SCHULZ

YET ANOTHER VA DEFINITION…
​“Visual analytics combines automated analysis techniques with interactive
visualizations for an effective understanding, reasoning and decision
making on the basis of very large and complex datasets.”
​Keim et al. 2008
​“Visual analytics combines the strengths of both worlds: On the one hand
they take advantage of intelligent algorithms and vast computational
power of modern computers and on the other hand they integrate human
background knowledge and intuition to find a good solution.”
​Keim et al. 2009

INFORMATION FORAGING
• We are “Informavores”. (see George Miller: “Informavores” in F. Machlup & U. Mansfield
(Eds.), The Study of Information: Interdisciplinary Messages (pp. 111-113) Wiley 1983)
• We “hunt” for information in similar ways as predators hunt for prey. (see Pirolli+Card, 1999)

SENSEMAKING
Sensemaking is an active two-way process of fitting data into a frame (mental model) and fitting a frame
around the data. Neither data nor frame comes first; data evoke frames and frames select a
